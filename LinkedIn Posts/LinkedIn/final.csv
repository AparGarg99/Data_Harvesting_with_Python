Often, I was a ‚Äúmentern,‚Äù a mentor, and an intern at the same time. I was learning as much from these young folks (almost all Millennials) as they were from me. When I‚Äôm overwhelmed with inputs, I tend to categorize things. With this firehose of mentorship opportunities cascading my way, I stumbled upon a convenient way to understand the two broad types of mentorship.When a mentee sees you as a subject matter expert, you are a Librarian. That may not sound sexy, but your know-how and know-who are exceptionally valuable. At Airbnb, a data scientist trying to propose a pricing mechanism for hosts might ask me about the tools hotels use to optimize their guest room pricing. When I was this kind of mentor, the mentee asked the questions, I answered them, and often directed the mentee to articles, white papers, books, and people who could give them a deeper dive into this subject. On average, this kind of relationship with a mentee lasted three sessions. It was finite. They were looking for answers that, hopefully, I could supply.The other kind of mentorship relationship tends to be more personal. Your role as the Confidante is to help your mentee understand themselves more as a human. Instead of you answering the questions, you‚Äôre more often asking the questions. I‚Äôll never forget when one of my Airbnb direct reports told me I was her Confidante. I laughed and told her she hadn‚Äôt shared any juicy details with me yet. She responded, ‚ÄúIn my part of France, a confidante is the one who gives you confidence. You help me see what I do well and what needs work, along with a roadmap of how I can improve.‚Äù This kind of relationship is far from finite as it may last months or years, and you may have a life-altering impact on this mentee‚Äôs life. In sum, not all mentorships fit neatly into one or the other type as, in some, you might start as a Librarian and evolve into a Confidante. But, I‚Äôve found this categorization to be immensely clarifying in helping me understand how I might best serve my mentee.",[]

It doesn't actually tell you anything.  As a data scientist everything you do involves data.  So much so, I've seen hundreds of notebooks where the word is splattered everywhere like a valley girl sprinkling the word 'like' in every sentence--data this, data that.  It's really unnecessary.Don't use `cars_data` or `cars_df`  just use `cars`.Don't use `query_data` use `query_{table_name}`.Don't use `save_data` do `save_to_csv`.  Don't use `plot_data` use `plot_bar_chart`.This is only a few examples but I hope you get the picture.  Try to be specific and your code will become clearer.That data represents something so use those words instead.  Often times you can get a good idea of better words to use by looking at database table names.  If you are creating a helper function that will work on lots of different datasets, try to focus on the operation you are doing.As a note: avoid using alternate synonyms too.  Words like ""info"", ""facts"", ""details"" should also be avoided.#CleanCode #DataScience #DataEngineering",[]

Find a smaller project that takes 2 to 3 months to deliver. Build the framework, and replicate the process from one team to the next.ùü∞. ùó¶ùòÅùóÆùòÅùó≤-ùóºùó≥-ùòÅùóµùó≤-ùóÆùóøùòÅ ùóÆùóπùó¥ùóºùóøùó∂ùòÅùóµùó∫ ùòÅùóøùó∂ùòÇùó∫ùóΩùóµùòÄ ùóºùòÉùó≤ùóø ùòÄùó∂ùó∫ùóΩùóπùó≤ ùóÆùóπùó¥ùóºùóøùó∂ùòÅùóµùó∫ùòÄMaybe, but not always.

SQL is one of the must have skill, If you are looking for a career in any data-centric profiles, be it data analyst, data scientist, business analytics, database developer, admin.  SQL is the starting point for any career in Data Industry, SQL deals with transforming, accessing, and finding patterns in data in its most basic form.  SQL journey start with small database concepts that covers database management systems as theory, where your learn objects, attributes, records, tuple, normalization, etc. Once you know theory, you need to practice using any of the database software. Database software can be licensed or open source like Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB, MYSQL, PostgreSQL, etc. All the Database Software works in the same ways with little bit of difference.  SQL is the language that is used to work on database. SQL has various commands like DDL, DML & DCL. SQL is very less and easy to understand, once you complete any of courses you may feel like you know SQL. but in reality people find it hard when it comes to implementation of SQL. So one needs to practice a lot, Pick any business domain, choose dataset and start practicing by create lot and lots of questions. SQL as a language is not only one of the most sought-after skills, but also one of the most well-paying.Most importantly, an adequate level of SQL and understanding how to play with data can help you land SQL developer, Database warehouse admin, and even data scientist jobs. Despite it being easy to learn, SQL‚Äôs use makes it a must for any organization as handling data before working on it with data science and Big Data tools mostly need simple processing.  You might surprise that in interviews related to Data Engineer or Data Scientist job profile. One may face lot of questions related to SQL.Follow Sourabh Sahu  to learn SQL.",[]

This is looking at things like git-based version control to ensure they have good reproducibility and reliability on these methods. ‚≠êÔ∏è If you're getting started with git-based version control, check out our meetup on Tuesday (10/25 at 12 ET) with Mouna Belaid, First Steps in Learning the Use of Git & GitHub in RStudio: üóì rstd.io/git-meetupAlso - James Wade shares those 4 guidelines below:1. Data organizationThese are things that I imagine are familiar to many of you. Like storing our data in tidy data tables or and storing our data in a managed system of record. 2. Data analysis We want to separate out our data storage and our analysis workflows. We also want to create some transparency in terms of how we analyze our data. This is looking at things like git-based version control to ensure that we have good reproducibility and reliability on these methods. 3. Data accessThis is a particular challenge for much of our research where we're using often proprietary data formats. This is where we want to make sure that we can store data in a way that's going to be accessible for the long term. We can have organized data, but it needs to be both organized and accessible in order for us to have that durable value out of that.4. Value preservation We're teaching our citizen data scientists to package their analyses so they can be leveraged by others who might not understand all of the intricate details of their particular project. But they can go and still leverage that key subject matter expertise that's encoded in that package so that it can continue to further innovation long past the lifetime of the individual project. We have a significant program named across all of these guidelines here. They're easier said than done. But this is our ambition for where we're aiming our citizen data science program to head towards.¬†https://lnkd.in/eqDjRjnq",[]

ETH Zurich,3 days ago,"+++ Why do we need a sociotechnical perspective for trustworthy AI and what does this mean in practice? +++It's a wrap üé¨ - Amir Mikail and I just gave our presentation at this year's #isaca2022 and we had a blast üéâ . (If you missed it, check out our AWK Group AG Trustworthy AI Masterclass, which Belinda M√ºller and I will be conducting on November 30 4pm-6pm. Tickets are available here: https://lnkd.in/e25-jGuQ )I particularly liked the questions from the audience:üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è If we are fully compliant with future regulation of the EU AI Act, what are we still missing?üëâ Given our experience with GDPR, being compliant with regulations will allow us to cover the basics. However, there is always some wiggle room, when it comes to interpreting legal texts. Take dark patterns for example - here we are clearly in the realm of ethics and conflicting incentives. We expect similar effects with future AI regulation. üëâ In a quickly developing field such as AI and other emerging technologies, regulation will always lag behind technological developments. Therefore, we will not reach a state where we will be ""done"" with trustworthy AI by complying to current regulatory rules.üë©‚Äçüíº Who is accountable for AI failures and how can we make sure that we mitigate AI risks on a day to day basis?üëâ Accountability cannot lie with individual data scientists, however we can create structures that allow us to mitigate risks in our daily operations. Data Science best practices such as pair coding allow both for two sets of eyes to check a code and to make sure that knowledge transfer is guaranteed in case of individual data scientists leaving.üëâ While the role of ethics boards is important to anchor trustworthy AI in organizations, accountability must exist on the executive level, which might be represented in such a board. As the WEF points out, new roles such as Chief AI (Ethics) officers will be created in the future reflecting this importance.üè≠  Is trustworthy AI relevant in non-client facing use cases e.g., in the manufacturing sector? üëâ When we think about trustworthy AI we tend to think of use cases where AI systems have given discriminatory recommendations. However, some trustworthy AI system characterisitcs such as safety and security also apply to use cases that don't use personal data. üëâ  Critical infrastructure are another exmaple, where trustworthy AI plays a role.

You should know in and out of working and execution of Programmatic Advertising. If you have worked with Publishers, thorough knowledge of Google Ad Manager and execution of each and every work through GAM is a must along with reporting. 2. For people working on Advertiser side or Ad  Agency side the knowledge Of DV 360 is a must.3. The usage of CDP and DMP platform along with GAM or DV 360 is an added advantage.The process of integration should be clear .4. As we are heading towards a cookileless world CDP Platforms will be in much more demand to unify the first party user data .5. If you are using Google Analytics 4 along with GAM it is a great add on to your work experience. Myths and Necessities 1. In Programmatic Advertising you need to be Proficient in Advanced Excel -It is a very parochial concept from the view point of any interviewer asking such type of question to a Programmatic Advertising Professional. You should have a good working knowledge of Excel as most of the GAM reports can be fetched via pre-set templates or queries, there is hardly too much of excel required to get the desired data or report ,so  basic Execl Working knowledge is enough. 2. Data Science Proficient professionals are required in Programmatic Advertising. You need to have different sets of  data for different type of campaigns, which you can get via GAM, CDP platform or Analytics Platform or via GAM Audience Buckets.Data Scientists or Experts have a different domain of work and you dont necessarily need to have a diploma ,degree or certification in that case.3. You should know about SDK and APIs which are building blocks in various  Ad Networks integration on any Publisher platform, Ad Agency ,Ad Tech Platform.This is a requirement which you should not ignore and having a good working knowledge of how integration takes place via SDK ,what is the primary purpose of SDK and API is necessary. Above all you should be confident in your abilities to manage everything on the platform in the individual role allotted to you but at the same time you dont need to be a Programmatic Advertising Expert and Data Scientist at the same time to fit in the given role you are appearing for.Not everyone is looking out for a techie and a management graduate to fill in the position floatedüòÄ .Your current proficiency in your job matters more than anything else.And finally dont request or plead in any way for the desired job ,if you deserve it ,you will get it.All the best to all fellow Programmatic Advertising Professionals for a bright and shining career ahead.#googleadmanager #programmaticadvertising #Programmaticjobs #dataanalytics #datascience #msexcel #job #career #experience #management #network #analytics #googleanalytics #people #interview",[]

There is one thing I‚Äôm coming back to again and again in my thoughts throughout my career. I can't remember when it comes to me for the first time. But I can tell that at least several times a week I‚Äôm thinking about it.If you are a programmer you probably guess what it is. Where are you going with all your questions or errors while developing or debugging your code? Obviously to Stack Overflow. Anything from powershall to python packages, from flutter plugins to telegram bot api you can find answers there. Everything but WAY4.Nowadays instead of reading documentation people just try, get an error and resolve it by looking into Stack Overflow. By saying Stack Overflow I mean this approach in general. It might be GitHub if we are talking about open source projects or Kaggle for data scientists. The idea is to use the power of community for the benefit of everyone.Let's say you have an error or struggle with some difficult task. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve spent 4 hours to resolve it by reading documentation, analyzing logs and trying several options. Imagine there are other 10 people who struggle with the same issue. In an absence of community and cooperation each of them also spend 4 hours to resolve the same issue. 40 precious hours of people's lives are wasted. Such a shame!I‚Äôm not naive. I know that there are several obstacles. First the problem of freerider. Such systems tend to exploit most active members for the benefit of more lazy ones. Second intellectual properties. To what extent an employee of one organization is allowed to share results of his work to the community, knowing that this info can be used for the benefit of another organization? Third is the scale. How many users needed to have it beneficial?I know that companies are trying to resolve it at least on an organizational level. Each company I was working for had a corporate wiki (confluence) to keep know-how and issue tracker (jira) to track the issues. However the level of reuse within one single organization is obviously an order of magnitude less. There are 100+ companies using WAY4, so I guess it might be around 1000 people who work with this platform day to day. I guess we all are facing more or less the same situations and wasting time to resolve something already resolved by someone somewhere.It‚Äôs hard to explain this thing to people who never use Stack Overflow. And it doesn‚Äôt require any explanation for people who do. Every time I‚Äôm getting a solution there I feel how smart and powerful the community is. It's an amazing feeling of synergy and balance.Do you believe it‚Äôs possible to implement for WAY4? What obstacles do you see?#way4 #community",[]
